# InterviewByJS
Interview question case that answered by JavaScript

#### Environment

It requires `NodeJS (1.14.15+)`

`Webstorm` is recommended. 

Install dependencies: 
```
npm install
```

<hr>

All the interview question cases are located in `/src/*`

<hr>

Add new interview case: 

```
npm run new yourPath/yourFile
```

After executing the command, you are also required to input your case name, such as `Leetcode 1 Two Sum`.

It would create three new files `yourFile.mjs`, `yourFile.test.mjs`, and `yourFile.readme.md` under the folder `/src/yourPath/`. 

<hr>

`yourFile.mjs` -> Interview response

`yourFile.test.mjs` -> Interview response testing

`yourFile.readme.md` -> Interview question case description.
